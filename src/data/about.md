# About Me

I am a dedicated Computer Science graduate student at Indiana University Bloomington with a strong foundation in mathematics and computing from IIT Guwahati. My academic journey spans multiple domains including cloud computing, data science, machine learning, and network security.

Currently serving as a Television Master Controller, Schedule Director, and Data Analyst at WFIU/WTIU, I apply my technical expertise in real-world digital system operations, managing broadcast schedules, and analyzing audience data to optimize programming strategies.

My experience demonstrates the practical application of computer science principles in diverse industries, from educational technology to media broadcasting, showcasing my ability to adapt technical skills to various professional contexts.

# My Journey

My passion for technology and problem-solving has driven me to work on diverse projects across multiple domains. From building full-stack healthcare platforms to developing scalable cloud analytics systems, I've consistently focused on creating solutions that have real-world impact.

## Building CalmCompass

Building CalmCompass was an incredible learning experience that pushed me to tackle real-world problems from database connections to deployment challenges. I started with a vision to create an emotional wellness tracking app, but quickly realized that every step came with its own set of obstacles.

The first major hurdle was understanding how to connect my Next.js application to a production database—I initially struggled with environment variables and connection strings, learning the hard way that Supabase requires a connection pooler for serverless deployments on Vercel rather than direct database connections.

When my first deployment resulted in 404 errors on every route, I spent hours debugging before discovering that Vercel's framework detection had defaulted to "Other" instead of "Next.js"—a simple configuration issue that taught me the importance of verifying deployment settings.

The challenges didn't stop there: I encountered React infinite loop errors due to improper hook dependencies, which forced me to deeply understand React's Rules of Hooks and proper useEffect patterns. UI refinements like making actions collapsible, fixing action count displays, and improving text visibility required multiple iterations of user testing and feedback.

Perhaps the most valuable lesson came from deciding on the tech stack—I weighed options between TypeScript and JavaScript, Prisma and raw SQL, Supabase and self-hosted databases, each decision requiring research into trade-offs between developer experience, type safety, scalability, and deployment complexity.

Implementing the AI chatbot feature introduced me to API integration with Groq, error handling patterns, and the importance of graceful fallbacks when external services fail. Through each bug fix, refactor, and feature addition, I learned that persistence, systematic debugging, and breaking complex problems into smaller pieces are essential skills.

The project evolved from a simple idea into a fully functional application, and every challenge I overcame made me a more confident and capable developer.

# Technical Interests

I'm particularly passionate about:
- **Full-Stack Development**: Building end-to-end solutions that solve real problems
- **Data Science & Analytics**: Extracting meaningful insights from complex datasets
- **Cloud Computing**: Designing scalable, distributed systems on AWS and Azure
- **Machine Learning**: Implementing ML models and optimizing their performance
- **Software Engineering**: Writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices

# Education & Learning

My academic journey has taken me from IIT Guwahati, where I built a strong foundation in mathematics and computing, to Indiana University Bloomington, where I'm specializing in advanced topics like cloud computing, big data applications, and network security.

I believe in continuous learning and hands-on experience. Whether it's through coursework, personal projects, or real-world work experience, I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and skills.
